![Netflix Logo](https://github.com/marufnawaz/netflix_sql_project/blob/main/logo.png)

## Overview

This project entails a thorough analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows data utilizing SQL. The primary objective is to derive valuable insights and address several business questions using the dataset. The following README offers a comprehensive overview of the projectâ€™s goals, the business challenges encountered, the solutions implemented, key findings, and final conclusions.

## Objectives

- Examine the distribution of content categories (movies vs. TV shows).
- Determine the most prevalent ratings for both movies and TV shows.
- Compile and analyze content according to release years, countries, and durations.
- Investigate and classify content based on specific criteria and keywords.

## Dataset

The data for this particular project is downloaded from kaggle

- **Dataset Link:** [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)

## Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE netflix (
show_id	VARCHAR(6),
type VARCHAR(10),
title VARCHAR(160),
director VARCHAR(210),
cast VARCHAR(1000),	
country	VARCHAR(150),
date_added	VARCHAR(50),
release_year INT,
rating VARCHAR(10),	
duration VARCHAR(15),
listed_in	VARCHAR(250),
description VARCHAR(250)
);
```
## Business Problems and Solutions

### 1. Count the Number of Movies vs TV Shows

```sql
SELECT 
	type,
	COUNT(*)
FROM netflix
GROUP BY type
```
**Objective:** Determine the distribution of content types on Netflix

### 2. Find the most common rating for movies and TV shows

```sql
WITH CountRating AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*) AS rating_count
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
),
RankedRatings AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        rating_count,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY rating_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM CountRating
)
SELECT 
    type,
    rating AS most_frequent_rating
FROM RankedRatings
WHERE rank = 1;
```
**Objective:** Identify the most frequently occurring rating for each type of content.

### 3. List all movies released in a specific year (e.g., 2020)

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM netflix
WHERE release_year = 2020
```
**Objective:** Retrieve all movies released in a specific year.

### 4. Find the top 5 countries with the most content on Netflix

sql```
SELECT *
FROM
(
    SELECT TOP 5 
        value AS country, 
        COUNT(*) AS total_content
    FROM netflix
    CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(country, ',')
    WHERE value IS NOT NULL -- ensuring nulls are filtered
    GROUP BY value
) AS t1
ORDER BY total_content DESC;
```
**Objective:** Identify the top 5 countries with the highest number of content items.

### 5. Identify the longest movie

sql```
SELECT TOP 1 *
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY 
    CAST(SUBSTRING(duration, 1, CHARINDEX(' ', duration) - 1) AS INT) DESC;
```
**Objective:** Find the movie with the longest duration.

-- 9. Count the number of content items in each genre
SELECT 
    SplitGenres.value AS genre, 
    COUNT(*) AS total_content

GROUP BY SplitGenres.value;


-- 10. Find each year and the average numbers of content release by India on netflix. 
-- return top 5 year with highest avg content release !


SELECT TOP 5
    country,
    release_year,
    COUNT(show_id) AS total_release,
    ROUND(
        CAST(COUNT(show_id) AS NUMERIC) /
        CAST((SELECT COUNT(show_id) FROM netflix WHERE country = 'India') AS NUMERIC) * 100, 
        2
    ) AS avg_release
FROM netflix
WHERE country = 'India'
GROUP BY country, release_year
ORDER BY avg_release DESC;



-- 11. List all movies that are documentaries
